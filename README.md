# Instagram clone in react native with firebase

### I had some troubles sending Image to the db. It was causing network error and wasted almost one day of my work. Post are going to be stored in local storage with redux


To run the app simply:

> Go to the instagram-clone folder and run:
> `npm i -g expo-cli`
> and
> `expo start`
